# 🔍 PokeAPI Fetch Project

This is a simple frontend web app that lets you search for a Pokémon by name and displays its sprite using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use the `fetch()` method to retrieve data from an API
- Handling async/await syntax for cleaner API calls
- Basic error handling with try/catch
- DOM manipulation to dynamically update the page
- Minimal but clean CSS styling for user input and image display

## 💡 How It Works

1. User types a Pokémon name into the input field.
2. Clicks the "Fetch Pokémon" button.
3. The app sends a request to the PokéAPI.
4. On success, it displays the Pokémon's front sprite.

If the Pokémon doesn't exist or there's an error fetching data, it logs an error in the console.
